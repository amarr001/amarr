# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 


## Directions

First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate your portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Create the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

## The project

*The three html files follow a basic structure: <head>, <header> and <body>. Inside the head I added Bootstrap plugins and referenced my css stylesheets. I also have a stylesheet for each html file, I am not sure if this is the most efficient way to do it. 

I used a responsive navbar in the head with a toggler, I achieved that by using bootstrap class "navbar-expand-lg" and data toggle: collapse. The way I got a responsive layout was to apply media query in the body using max-width/width:100% to avoid a horizontal scrollbar appearing in small screens. I also used Bootstrap grid system to have full control over how the items will behave as the screen changes to different sizes. 
I
am not completely happy with the outcome of the project, specially regarding the design of it, but I intend to keep pushing and trying to improve this portfolio further. 



### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project


## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

* Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
